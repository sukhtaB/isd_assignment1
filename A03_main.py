# 1.  Import all BankAccount types using the bank_account package
#     Import date
#     Import Client






# 2. Create a Client object with data of your choice.




# 3a. Create a ChequingAccount object with data of your choice, using the client_number 
# of the client created in step 2.
# 3b. Create a SavingsAccount object with data of your choice, using the client_number 
# of the client created in step 2.





# 4 The ChequingAccount and SavingsAccount objects are 'Subject' objects.
# The Client object is an 'Observer' object.  
# 4a.  Attach the Client object (created in step 1) to the ChequingAccount object (created in step 2).
# 4a.  Attach the Client object (created in step 1) to the SavingsAccount object (created in step 2).





# 5a. Create a second Client object with data of your choice.
# 5b. Create a SavingsAccount object with data of your choice, using the client_number 
# of the client created in this step.




# 6. Use the ChequingAccount and SavingsAccount objects created 
# in steps 3 and 5 above to perform transactions (deposits and withdraws) 
# which would cause the Subject (BankAccount) to notify the Observer 
# (Client) as well as transactions that would not 
# cause the Subject to notify the Observer.  Ensure each 
# BankAccount object performs at least 3 transactions.
# REMINDER: the deposit() and withdraw() methods can raise exceptions
# ensure the methods are invoked using proper exception handling such 
# that any exception messages are printed to the console.
