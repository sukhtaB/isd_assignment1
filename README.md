# Intermediate Software Development Automated Teller Project
This project will be developed over the course of several assignments.  Each 
assignment will build on the work done in the previous assignment(s).  Ultimately, 
an entire system will be created to manage bank transactions for clients who 
have one or more bank accounts.

## Assignment
Assignment1: Classes, Encapsulation and Unit Test Planning.
In this assignment you will leverage the knowledge gained in Module 01 to develop classes to support a larger system. This is the first of many assignments in this course, each of which will build on the previous assignment in order to produce a complete system. The focus of this assignment aligns with the focus of the first module - that is, classes, encapsulation and unit test planning.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is about keeping the details of how an object works hidden and only allowing access through specific methods.

1. Private Data: BankAccount keeps its balance private, not directly accessible from outside the class.
2. Controlled Access: Balance can only be changed through methods like deposit() and withdraw().
3. Data Protection: Encapsulation ensures data integrity by preventing unauthorized access and modifications.
4. Secure Methods: The Transaction class also hides its internal details and exposes only necessary methods.
